## Features

```
1. To avoid AMOLED burn-ins, I added a simple script that will change the space between the TIME and DATE every 5 minutes. Feel free to change that too.
2. Thanks to a reddit comment, I added a free weather widget at the top by default. You can of course COMMENT IT OUT inside your forked index.html file...
3. Still polishing :)
